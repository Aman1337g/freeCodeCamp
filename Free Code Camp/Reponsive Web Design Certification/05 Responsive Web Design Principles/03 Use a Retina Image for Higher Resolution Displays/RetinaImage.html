<!--With the increase of internet connected devices, their sizes and specifications vary, and the displays they use 
    could be different externally and internally. Pixel density is an aspect that could be different on one device 
    from others and this density is known as Pixel Per Inch(PPI) or Dots Per Inch(DPI).

    The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, such as the MacBook Pros "retina
    display" is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is.

    Set the width and height of the img tag to half of their original values. In this case, both the original height and 
    the original width are 200px.-->


<style>
    img{height: 100px; width: 100px;}
